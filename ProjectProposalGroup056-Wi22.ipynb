    "In our study, we hypothesize that there is a positive relationship between the suicide rate of countries and the country’s average surface temperature, meaning the higher the average surface temperature of a country, the higher the suicide rate is in the country. We believe this is the case because an increase in overall temperature would lead to more stress and negative mood or aggression, leading to an overall deterioration of mental well-being. A higher deterioration of mental well-being can lead to things such as depression and may lead to higher rates of suicide in a country. "

If there are any issues with the data we found, we will remove the data source and replace it with another. Any following issues that are identified will be discussed with a TA for further assistance if needed. \n"
